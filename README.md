## About

Original design by Sam Thompson for Unseen Studios.
Photography by Grant Thomson for Suitcase Magazine.

This website was created to practice using Typescript and Tailwind for a modern fashion website with animation and responsive designs.

On desktop, the site transitions to a horizontal scroll, whether the user utilizes the traditional mousedown or swipes left to right. 
However, on mobile, it converts effortlessly into a responsive version that scrolls vertically.
The site also contains custom animations and components thanks to the Tailwind and React library.
